Welcome! Recently we've made a lot of changes to our shop...<br>
Now we sell all the goods you will need in your journey. Also we have a huge variety of potions and magic drinks. An experienced adventurer can make use of all those things. I would be glad to sell them to you if you have enough money.<br>
