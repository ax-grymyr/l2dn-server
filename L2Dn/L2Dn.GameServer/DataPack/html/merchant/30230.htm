Oh, you've come here, to the Hunters Village, for the first time? Then let me tell you some of our story. Well...<br>
This settlement was built by hunters who came here looking for rare entertainments. Saying 'entertainments' I mean hunting for dangerous beasts, of course. Don't think the founders of out village were hunting for rabbits! Even now hunters are noble people like members of royal family!<br>
