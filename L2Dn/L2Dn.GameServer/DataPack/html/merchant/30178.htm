Hello, my friend! Welcome to our shop! You won't findd more honest traders anywhere in the northen Aden.<br>
You may have heard some stupid rumors about me - that I'm at large, or an Elmore refugee, or even that I am a disguised Timak Orc! Crazy, eh? You don't believe them, do you? Haha...<br>
Anyway, take a look at my goods. You won't find more refined things in any other shop!<br>
