<html><body>Collector Stone:<br>
I can transform Scroll of Escape: Tower of Insolence info the Stone of Memory.<br>
But that's not easy, so there is a chance I will not succeed.<br>
As you probably know, <font color="LEVEL">Stone of Memory</font> doesn't disappear after use, you can use it as much as you like.<br>
If you already have a Scroll of Memory, I can exchange it for a Stone of Memory for a floor below.<br>
