Listen! I will tell you the story of our people's origin. The ancestor of Orcs was created in the blazing flame of Pa'agrio. His hair flared like fire; his eyes glared with fury, and anyone who dared to look into them had to turn away in pain; his lungs erupted ashes; and blood in his veins was as hot as lava. There was nobody in the whole world whose strength could compare to his!<br>
Years were passing, and with time the Energy of Water chilled his body, the Energy of Earth cooled his blood, and winds scattered the ashes of his lungs. Having lost his strength, the ancestor of Orcs was miserable. Seeing this, Pa'agrio revealed the greatest secret to him: fierce battles can make his blood boil, and hard trainings can bring back his former strength. Since then, Orcs have been renowned for their might, and our weapon mastery has become a legend!<br>
