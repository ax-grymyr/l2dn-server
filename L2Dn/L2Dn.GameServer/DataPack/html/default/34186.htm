Have we ever met? My name is Karen, I m an Ivory Tower Wizard.<br>
<br>
Do you want to know about hellbound? Here is a hideout of Beleth, the faller wizard who gathers magic of the island to become the most powerful spellcaster.<br>
For that reason he has made an alliance with Vampires.<br>
Ivory Tower Wizards presume that Beleth is going to overmaster all the continent. That s why they are looking for experienced warriors who can make him stop.<br>
All heroes who are ready to fight him and have reached<font color="LEVEL"> Lv.85 or higher </font>can go to hellbound<font color="LEVEL"> every Saturday from 10:00 to 22:00.</font>
