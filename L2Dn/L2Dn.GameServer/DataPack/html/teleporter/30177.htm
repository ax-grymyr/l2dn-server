<html><body>Gatekeeper Valentina:<br>
Greetings! I'm Gatekeeper Valentina, I can teleport you somewhere outside of the Ivory Tower. It is a common belief that our Tower is a den of madmen who think only of conquering the world. But there are some people here who are really trying to make the world a better place...<br>
What can I help you with? I'm the best Gatekeeper you can find here, you know.<br>
