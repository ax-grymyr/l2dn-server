<html><body>Undercover Agent Khamin:<br>
Sel Mahums have occupied Abandoned Camp.<br>
The camp is guarded by Escorts, their leaders are an elite warrior called Jisra and Escort Captain Cooca. The bastards  are getting very strong and dangerous.<br>
I have to ask for your help. We need to sound out the situation, so do it using a secret pathway.<br>
Be careful,the camp is guarded not only by the men but also powerful magic that can teleport you anywhere. Cooca is the one who cast it but even if you kill him spell won't be broken. So you aren't going to come back the same way you travel there,that's why you need to prepare a Scroll of Escape.<br>
