Come closer. Are you here to drop your belongings or for something else? I'm very tried so let's get to business. By the way, I work only on a prepaid basis. It's really stupid to carry all your belongings around. Much better if you put your unnecessaries into the stockroom. They will be in safe keeping there.<br>
