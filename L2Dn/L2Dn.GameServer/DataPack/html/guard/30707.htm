<html><body>Guard Raigen:<br>
Greetings! I'm Raigen, Captain of the Hunters Village guards. Nice to meet you! Our village was founded by hunters who came here in search of rare beasts from the Enchanted Valley and the Forest of Mirrors. Our lifestyle is somewhat unique, and even the Lord of Aden respects us and recognizes our right to self-rule. To a certain extent, of course.<br>
However, here as in any other place where rough men dwell you can't find easy life. Of course you can shut your eyes to many things but you can't do so with the Rogue Guild. There's a lot of talks about it but I've failed to catch any oof its members... If you meet someone suspicious, let me know.<br>
