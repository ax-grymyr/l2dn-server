Quiet! Silly talks are prohibited during the misson. Especially if your commander is nearby... But it can't be helped. I will be brief. This place is located near to the Oren border, so you always must stay alert.<br>
Besides, there's an interlocutory instruction to keep an eye open for one more place, the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower</font>.<br>
