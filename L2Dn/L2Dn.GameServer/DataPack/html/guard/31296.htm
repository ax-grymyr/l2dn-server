Be careful if you are going to leave town! A lot of dangerous monster roam the land right now. And also those constant fights between <font color="FFFF00">Varka Silenos of the West</font> and <font color="FFFF00">Ketra Orcs in the North</font>... I hope they kill each other and make our lives easier...<br>
Just remember that a wrong move may cost you your life outside the town!<br>
