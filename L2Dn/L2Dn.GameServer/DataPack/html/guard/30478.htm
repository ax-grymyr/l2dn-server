To the east of here you can find a vast lake. The Innadril Lake. Just a small part of it can be seen from its shore. Actually the lake is far vaster than it seems. There's a legend that the Water Dragon Fafurion is living on one of the islands. So our beatiful lake may prove to be a dangerous place.<br>
