Welcome! I'm Captain Bathis.<br>
My duty is maintaining the civil order in the village and its suburbs. May I ask you a question? What kind of clothing you've put on yourself? It's good to be in the fashion but... armor is not for showing off. You should choose sturdy and durable armor even if it looks rubbish. Oh men, you youngsters should know that...<br>
What? Will you look at that?! Over there! What is with the clothes these days!? I understand fashion trends, but in armor? You don't wear armor to make a fashion statement! It's there to protect your dainty hide! Tsk....tsk.... Young people these days.....<br>
And you still know nothing about <font color=LEVEL>automatic hunting</font> which can help you in combat.<br>
