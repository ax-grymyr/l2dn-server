The weather is fine today, isn't it? I'm really lucky, in fact I was never caught in the rain. Luck is one of the most important things in life. I had a friend... Once he got drunk and went pee. Long story short he reached <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>. Which means he passed the <font color="LEVEL">Defense Towers</font> without any scratch! With no armor on! How lucky is he?!<br>
