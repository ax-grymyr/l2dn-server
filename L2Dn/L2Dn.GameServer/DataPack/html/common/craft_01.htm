I think you are aware that this is a special place. And my skills are top notch.<br>
However, keep in mind that making dual swords is not always about skill. There is more to it than it appears. This weapon is considered one of the deadliest in the world, so its crafting is limited.<br>
A- and B-grade dual swords can be created only if you have Dual Sword Crafting Stamp.<br>
Bring it to me along with the swords you want to combine, and I will craft you the weapon of your dreams!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Please, keep in mind that any weapon modifications will be lost in the fusion process.</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Also I can't combine swords that are imbued with Soul Crystals, so please remove them beforehand.</font><br>
