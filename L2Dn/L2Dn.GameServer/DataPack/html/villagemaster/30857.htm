Welcome to Aden, the crown jewel of Elmoreden! It is considered the cltral and religious center of our kingdom. Many believe this Temple of Light to be the focus of our faith that attracts all workshippers of Einhasad.<br>
However, the true holiness can be found in the simplest of hearts. A country bumpkin's prayer can evoke the stronger response from the Mother of Light than High Priest's chanting. So our temple is not that differnt from others.<br>
