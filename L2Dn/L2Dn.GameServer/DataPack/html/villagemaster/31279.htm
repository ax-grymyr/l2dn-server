It's nice too see that even in such hard times there are still talented young warriors out there. My name is High Priest Gregory.<br>
As you, probably, know, a lot has been going on in Goddard lately... Varka Silenos and Ketra Orcs run rampant in the border lands, and we have received a word that Fire Dragon Valakas is awake... Now we really need help of such brilliant adventurers as you.<br>
Though we may hope for foreigners' help, but have to keep our swords sharp, right? Of course, we will do whatever we can to keep peace in our town...<br>
